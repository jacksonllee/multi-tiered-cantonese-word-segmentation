This data is the subset of the Hong Kong Cantonese Corpus (HKCanCor)
that has been re-segmented by the multi-tiered word segmentation scheme
described in the following paper:

    abstract = "Word segmentation for Chinese text data is essential for compiling corpora and any other tasks where the notion of {``}word{''} is assumed, since Chinese orthography does not have conventional word boundaries as languages such as English do. A perennial issue, however, is that there is no consensus about the definition of {``}word{''} in Chinese, which makes word segmentation challenging. Recent work in Chinese word segmentation has begun to embrace the idea of multiple word segmentation possibilities. In a similar spirit, this paper focuses on Cantonese, another major Chinese variety. We propose a linguistically motivated, multi-tiered word segmentation system for Cantonese, and release a Cantonese corpus of 150,000 characters word-segmented by this proposal. Our work will be of interest to researchers whose work involves Cantonese corpus data.",
